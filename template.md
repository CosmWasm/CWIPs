## Simple Summary

<!-- "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the CAIP. -->

## Abstract

<!-- A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed. -->

A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation

<!-- The motivation is critical for CAIP. It should clearly explain why the state of the art is inadequate to address the problem that the CAIP solves. CAIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright. -->

The motivation is critical for CAIP. It should clearly explain why the state of the art is
inadequate to address the problem that the CAIP solves. CAIP submissions without sufficient
motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification

<!-- The technical specification should describe the standard in detail. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations. -->

The technical specification should describe the standard in detail. The specification should be
detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.

## Rationale

<!-- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion. -->

## Backwards Compatibility

<!-- All CWIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CAIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. CAIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright. -->
